        <h2>Website Summary</h2>

        <h4>What content will the site contain?</h4>
            <p>My father(Donn) is in real estate and I plan to revamp his <a href="http://www.paradiselistings.com/" target="_blank">existing website.</a></p>

        <h4>Where will you get all of the content for your site (ie. images & text)?</h4>
            <p>I will keep the contents of the website primarily similar to what he currently has with the additional touchups here and there. Resources I will use will be from google, the existing website, or from Donn himself. </p>

        <h4>Why should users care about the focus of the site?</h4>
            <p>Anyone looking to buy or sell a house on Hawaii Island would care about the site. </p>

        <h4>Why should a site be built for this?</h4>
            <p>A site should be built for this because it provides for a way to get into contact with a realtor for those inquiring about home ownership in Hawaii.</p>

        <h4>What would you like users to do at your site?</h4>
            <p>I would like users to be able to get a grasp of who Donn is and be able to contact him if they wish to further inquire on buying or selling a house on Hawaii Island. I also would like if users were able to view current listing Donn has available through the website.</p>

        <h4>What is the goal of the site?</h4>
            <p>I want users to gather an idea of who Donn is and be able to decide if they want to take their real estate ventures to him. </p>
