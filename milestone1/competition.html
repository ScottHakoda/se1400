        <h2>Website Summary</h2>

        <h4>What the competition is doing right</h4>
            <blockquote><p>What I have seen from other real estate website that I like is their use of galleries to show off their current listings. Donn currently uses a link to an external site to search for listings which in my opinions isn't very user friendly. I also prefer the formatting of contact information and other site elements of the competitors' sites over Donn's</p></blockquote>

        <h4>What the competition is doing wrong</h4>
            <blockquote><p>One thing that I really like about Donn's website is that he states personal facts that display why he would be a good choice as a realtor. Competitors often just display their qualifications, statistics, and degrees which is fine, but I like the approach Donn takes with his website and plan to keep that style.</p></blockquote>
            
        <h4>How I can do it better</h4>
            <blockquote><p>I plan to revamp Donn's current website, primarily focusing on adding the gallery feature, fixing up the contact format, taking out broken links, and improving user experience. I hope to improve the overall quality of the website while still keeping the personal charm that the original website holds.</p></blockquote>
